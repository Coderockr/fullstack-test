Coding Challenge
================
The test is divided into two challenges. In the first you will build a simple blog API, and in the second implement an interface that consumes the data of your API.

## Design Reference

Design is available in Figma at [https://www.figma.com/file/ImqUersZbn3WGyBdiEjlwKyQ/Coderockr-Front-end-Test](https://www.figma.com/file/ImqUersZbn3WGyBdiEjlwKyQ/Coderockr-Front-end-Test). If you haven't already, sign up for a free Figma account, so you can work with the design.

Prototype: [https://www.figma.com/proto/ImqUersZbn3WGyBdiEjlwKyQ/Coderockr-Front-end-Test](https://www.figma.com/proto/ImqUersZbn3WGyBdiEjlwKyQ/Coderockr-Front-end-Test)

__NOTE 1:__ In this challenge we will not evaluate the implementation of design styles. __USE THE DESIGN MERELY AS A VISUAL AND STRUCTURAL REFERENCE.__ In fact, it’s perfectly fine to use some library of components to assist you in the development of the interface. Or if you prefer, feel free to implement your own components / styles.

__NOTE 2:__ For the images, you can download them from the unsplash.com API. EX: ```https://source.unsplash.com/640x640/?rock-concert```


#1. Challenge (API)
------------------

Build an API for a blog page that provides the following:

1. A news feed that shows the articles.
2. A way to create a new article with **title**, **author**, **cover image** and **body**.
3. A way to store and get blog contacts (contact form).
4. Please publish your solution into Github with a README.md file detailing the instructions on how to get the app up and running.
5. You can use any backend language or framework to solve this challenge.
6. Avoid using huge commits hiding your progress. Feel free to work on a branch and use rebase to adjust your commits before submitting the final version.

#2. Challenge (Frontend Interface)
------------------

Create a Web interface for the API you created. Must have the following features:

1. Create the interface using any technology of your preference. (TIP: component-oriented frameworks/libs helps accelerate the development process)
2. Make it responsive using your best judgement.
1. Create a page to show the published articles.
2. Implements a way to view a single article in the blog.
3. Implements a way to create new articles.
4. Create a page with a contact form, where the user can send their __name, email, phone, and message__.
6. Avoid using huge commits that may hide your progress.

Project Deadline
---------------

Ideally you'd finish the test project in 5 days. It shouldn't take you longer than a entire week.

Evaluation Criteria
------------------

1. Understanding of design patterns, OO concepts and other related concepts.
2. The tools of choice to solve the problem.
3. Code and component reuse/extensibility.
4. Ability to write test code.
5. Code design.
6. Ability to write clear documentation.
7. Separation of frontend and backend.

Submission
----------

1. A link to the Github repository.
2. Briefly describe how you decided on the tools that you used.
